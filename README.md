## About

Chaos Type is an improved version of of the orginal "[Chaos Keys](https://devpost.com/software/chaos-keys)" game, which was initially developed during SystemsHack 2024, where it won the Chaos Chefs Award. It was a beginner friendly, twelve-hour Hackathon I participated in. It's designed as a fast-paced typing exercise aimed to improve your typing skills and reaction time.

## Features

In the first interation, players faced the challenged of typing words that appeared in columns before they reached the bottom of the screen. While this concept introduced the core gamplay, Chaos Type takes it a step futher with several key improvements.

- Randomized Word Appearance:
Instead of columns, words now appear randomly on the game screen, and the player must type them before they disappear, adding a new layer of reaction-type.
  
- Local Storage Score Tracking:
Your scores are now saved locally within the browser, allowing you to track your      progression.
  
- Enhanced Gameplay:
Chaos Type no longer relies on the RandomWord Dictionary API, which results in           faster performance and smoother gameplay.
  
- Improved UI/UX:
The user interface has been redesigned, offering a more visually appealing and user friendly-experience.
